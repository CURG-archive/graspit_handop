//! A task is an database record of some experiment that we want to run
/*! Usually, a task will involve an object, a hand, and some sort of
    experiment, such as planning grasps and recording them in the database.
    This class encapsulates a task, plus it offers some connections so that
    the task can be run automatically by a TaskDispatcher.

    A Task is responsible for its own event management. It must use a callback
    system (i.e. surrender control and then get it back later via its own timers
    or callbacks). For example, this can be achieved by using one of the EGPlanners,
    which do that natively.

    A Task must implement the following interface:
    
    - at the beginning, the TaskDispatcher will call the start() fctn. The 
    Task must starts its own event management from there. If the Task has
    been started well, start() must leave mStatus = RUNNING. Otherwise, it
    must leave mStatus = ERROR; start() must then surrender control.

    - when the Task is done, it is responsible for setting its own mStatus to
    DONE. The TaskDispatcher wakes up periodically and checks on this. When it
    sees that the status of the Task is DONE it will clean up and continue to
    another task.

//! A high-level executive that dispatches tasks based on the contents of the database
/*! The TaskDispatcher is in charge of reading the list of tasks to be
    executed from the database, creating and startinng the appropriate
    instances of the Task class and then monitoring them.

    It uses a callback timer to wake up periodically and check on the currently
    running task.

    On exit, the Dispatcher will exit GraspIt's main loop, thus terminating the
    application. Before doing that, it will set its own status to inform the
    main app of the outcome of the tasks. It can exit because:

    - it has performed a pre-set maximum number of tasks

    - no more tasks to be executed are listed in the database

    - one of the executed tasks has returned an error
