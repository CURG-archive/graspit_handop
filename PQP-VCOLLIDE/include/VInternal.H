Filename: VInternal.H

Description: This file declares three classes - VCReportType,
             VCObject and VCInternal.
             VCReportType is a simple class through which
             collisions are reported.
             VCObject holds all the necessary information
             about an object.
             VCInternal contains the implementation of VCollide.
