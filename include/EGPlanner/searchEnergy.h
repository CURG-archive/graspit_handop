/*!	This class can compute the "quality" (or in other terms "energy") of a
	HandObjectState. There are many ways of doing this which are all right now 
	hidden in the protected functions and managed by the mType flag. In the 
	near future I plan to re-write this using inheritance instead of 
	switch(...) but I never got around to doing that.

	The various type of energy calculations used are a bit fuzzy too, 
	re-organization will help when it happens. For now, I will not provide 
	very detailed documentation here, as I am really embarassed by this code
	and plan to re-write it as soon as possible.
